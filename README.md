MATLAB scripts for the Arctic CORDEX data analysis
All the scripts are originally by Asgeir Sorteberg, UiB, written for CORDEX data. Modified here for Arctic CORDEX data formats.
Modifications mainly include the rotation of the metadata in "CORDEX_read_time_area_slice.m" and some writing edits in "example_CORDEX_ensemble_mean_latlon_plot.m". All the changes are described in the corresponding codes.
